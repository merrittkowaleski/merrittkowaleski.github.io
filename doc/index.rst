Hi, I'm Merritt!
I'm a software developer at the `Auton Lab <https://autonlab.org/>`_ at Carnegie Mellon University.
I assist researchers in transforming their novel machine learning ideas into production code, with an emphasis on robustness, maintainability, extendability, and user-friendliness
I particularly enjoy creating documentation with Sphinx, which is why I used it to make this website.

I am currently leading algorithm evaluation for `Team Chiron <https://teamchiron.ai/>`_ as we take part in the DARPA Triage Challenge.
I also co-led the development of `|ngautonml| <https://autonlab.gitlab.io/ngautonml/index.html>`_, Auton Lab's in-house automl software.
Check out :doc:`projects` for more details.
